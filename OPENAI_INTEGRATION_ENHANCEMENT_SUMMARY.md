  wordCount?: number;
  model?: string;
  isStubbed?: boolean;
  cost?: number;
  rateLimitInfo?: { remaining: number; resetTime: number };
}
```

### 2. AI_STUB Mode Implementation

**Environment Variable**: `AI_STUB=1`

**Features**:

**Capabilities**:
- ✅ User usage statistics with date ranges
- ✅ System-wide usage analytics (admin only)
- ✅ Daily usage limit enforcement
- ✅ Cost tracking and budget alerts
- ✅ Model usage analytics
- ✅ Daily usage charts (30-day history)
- ✅ Role-based access control

**Key Functions**:
- `getUserUsageStats()` - Individual user statistics
- `getSystemUsageStats()` - System-wide analytics
- `canUserMakeRequest()` - Rate limit checking
- `getCostAlerts()` - Budget threshold monitoring
- `trackAIRequest()` - Request logging

### 4. Debug Routes for Monitoring

**Added Routes**:
- ✅ `/debug/openai-config` - Configuration and limits (admin only)
- ✅ `/debug/openai-usage` - Usage statistics per user
- ✅ `/debug/openai-stub` - Test stub responses
- ✅ `/debug/enqueue` - Queue testing functionality

### 5. Doctor-Specific Settings Integration

**Enhanced Settings**:
- ✅ `maxWords` - Per-doctor word limits
- ✅ `communicationTone` - Response tone preferences
- ✅ `readingLevel` - Patient-appropriate language level
- ✅ `specialtyFocus` - Medical specialty context
- ✅ `signOff` - Custom signature preferences

### 6. Enhanced Error Handling

**Error Types Handled**:
- ✅ OpenAI API rate limits (429)
- ✅ Authentication failures (401)
- ✅ Content policy violations (403)
- ✅ Service unavailability (5xx)
- ✅ Network timeouts and retries
- ✅ Input validation errors
- ✅ Daily limit exceeded errors

### 7. Cost and Usage Monitoring

**Cost Tracking**:
- ✅ Real-time cost calculation per request
- ✅ Model-specific pricing (GPT-4o-mini: $0.15/$0.60 per 1M tokens)
- ✅ Daily and monthly cost aggregation
- ✅ Budget alert thresholds by role
- ✅ Usage trending and forecasting data

**Budget Thresholds**:
- Admin: $10/day, $200/month
- Doctor: $5/day, $100/month  
- Reviewer: $2/day, $50/month
- Staff: $1/day, $20/month

### 8. Comprehensive Testing Suite

**File**: `test-openai-integration.js`

**Test Coverage**:
- ✅ Configuration validation
- ✅ Stub mode functionality
- ✅ API endpoint testing
- ✅ Different inquiry types
- ✅ Rate limiting verification
- ✅ Response quality validation

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Environment Configuration

**wrangler.jsonc** updates:
```json
{
  "vars": {
    "AI_STUB": "1"  // Local development
  }
}
```

### Model Selection Strategy

**Role-based Model Assignment**:
- All roles currently use `gpt-4o-mini` for cost efficiency
- Easily configurable for role-specific models in production

### Safety and Security Features

1. **Content Filtering**: Blocks unsafe medical advice
2. **HIPAA Compliance**: No conversation storage (`store: false`)
3. **Input Sanitization**: Length limits and validation
4. **Rate Limiting**: Per-user daily limits
5. **Error Sanitization**: No sensitive data in error messages

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Request Timeouts**: 30-second timeout with 2 retries
2. **Processing Time Tracking**: Full request lifecycle monitoring
3. **Database Query Optimization**: Efficient usage lookups
4. **Caching Strategy**: Ready for Redis implementation

## 📊 Test Results

**Latest Test Run**: 8/9 tests passed (89% success rate)

**Successful Tests**:
- ✅ OpenAI Configuration
- ✅ Stub Mode Testing  
- ✅ API Draft Generation
- ✅ Multiple Inquiry Types (3/3)
- ✅ Rate Limiting (5/5 rapid requests)

**Known Issues**:
- ⚠️ Usage Statistics endpoint needs Drizzle ORM schema fixes

## 📈 Usage Examples

### Generated Draft Sample
```
Hello John Doe,

Thank you for your inquiry about your medication. I understand your concern about experiencing side effects.

Based on your current medications (Lisinopril 10mg daily, Metformin 1000mg twice daily, Aspirin 81mg daily), I want to address your question carefully. Given your allergies to Penicillin (rash), Sulfa drugs (severe allergic reaction), we need to be particularly careful.

For medication-related questions, I recommend scheduling an appointment so we can review your current regimen and discuss any adjustments that might be needed.

Best regards,
Your Healthcare Team
```
