4. **Queue Producer Tests (`queue-producer.test.ts`)**
   - Job enqueueing and validation
   - Batch operations
   - Priority and scheduling
   - Error recovery mechanisms

### Integration Tests Created
1. **API Integration Tests (`api.integration.test.ts`)**

## 🔧 Key Features Implemented

### Database Integration
- ✅ Drizzle ORM integration with D1
- ✅ Automatic schema migration in tests
- ✅ Test data seeding with realistic fixtures
- ✅ Proper cleanup between test runs
- ✅ Graceful handling of missing D1 environment

### Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ JWT token generation for test users
- ✅ Role-based test scenarios (admin, doctor, auditor)
- ✅ Authenticated request helpers
- ✅ Authorization header management

### Environment Mocking
- ✅ OpenAI API mocking (AI_STUB=1 mode)
- ✅ Queue service mocking
- ✅ Delivery provider mocking
- ✅ Sentry integration mocking

### Test Utilities
- ✅ Response validation helpers
- ✅ JSON and CSV response handling
- ✅ Common assertion patterns
- ✅ Error status validation utilities

## 🚀 Verification Results

### ✅ Basic Test Execution Working
```bash
pnpm vitest run tests/unit/simple.test.ts
# ✓ tests/unit/simple.test.ts (3 tests) 27ms
# Test Files  1 passed (1)
# Tests  3 passed (3)
```

### ✅ Workers Runtime Integration
- Cloudflare Workers environment properly configured
- D1 database bindings working
- Queue producer bindings configured
- Environment variable injection working

### ✅ Configuration Validation
- Vitest configuration working with Workers pool
- React server conditions properly set
- Wrangler configuration fixed for assets
- Test isolation and concurrency working

## ⚠️ Known Limitations & Workarounds

### Coverage Reporting
- **Issue**: V8 coverage provider incompatible with Workers runtime (`node:inspector` module not available)
- **Workaround**: Coverage disabled in Workers environment
- **Alternative**: Use standard Node.js environment for coverage when needed

### React Server Components
- **Issue**: Some test files may have React server component import issues
- **Workaround**: React server conditions configured in vitest.config.ts
- **Status**: Basic tests working, complex component tests may need adjustment

### External Dependencies
- **OpenAI API**: Mocked by default with AI_STUB=1
- **Sentry**: Mocked for testing environment
- **Queue Processing**: Uses Miniflare simulation

## 📝 Usage Guide

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all unit tests
pnpm test:unit

# Run specific test file
pnpm vitest run tests/unit/simple.test.ts

# Watch mode for development
pnpm test:watch

# Verbose output
pnpm vitest run tests/unit/simple.test.ts --reporter=verbose
```

### Development Workflow
1. Write tests in appropriate `tests/unit/` or `tests/integration/` directory
2. Use test utilities from `tests/utils/` for common operations
3. Run tests in watch mode during development
4. Verify tests pass before committing changes

### Test Environment Variables
- `AI_STUB=1`: Enables OpenAI API mocking
- `ENVIRONMENT=test`: Sets test environment mode
- `JWT_SECRET`: Test-specific JWT secret for token validation

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Complete Test Implementation**: Finish implementing the remaining unit and integration tests
2. **CI/CD Integration**: Set up automated testing in deployment pipeline
3. **Coverage Alternative**: Implement coverage reporting outside Workers environment

### Future Enhancements
1. **Performance Testing**: Add performance benchmarks for critical paths
2. **Security Testing**: Implement security-specific test scenarios
3. **E2E Testing**: Add Playwright tests for browser interactions
4. **Load Testing**: Add stress testing for queue processing
