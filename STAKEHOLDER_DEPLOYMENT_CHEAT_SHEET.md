## 🚀 **PART 1: Quick Setup (10 minutes)**

### **Prerequisites** 
- **Computer**: Mac/Windows/Linux with internet connection
- **Time Required**: 10-15 minutes setup + 30 minutes exploration

### **Step 1: Install Required Software**

**If you have Node.js installed**, skip to Step 2. Otherwise:

```bash
# Download and install Node.js 18+ from: https://nodejs.org/
# Verify installation:
node --version    # Should show v18.x.x or higher
```

**Install pnpm** (faster package manager):
```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

### **Step 2: Download the AI Concierge MVP**

Open Terminal/Command Prompt and run:

```bash
# Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/computer-internet-man/concierge-doctor-bot.git

# Navigate to project
cd concierge-doctor-bot

# Install dependencies (takes 2-3 minutes)
pnpm install
```

### **Step 3: Configure Environment**

```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .dev.vars

# IMPORTANT: Add OpenAI API key to .dev.vars file
# Open .dev.vars in any text editor and replace:
# OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key-here"
# With your actual OpenAI API key
```

**💡 No OpenAI key?** Contact the development team - the app will run but AI features will show mock responses.

### **Step 4: Initialize Database & Start Application**

```bash
# Setup database with sample data
pnpm run generate
pnpm run migrate:dev
pnpm run seed

# Start the application (takes 30 seconds)
pnpm run dev
```

**✅ Success Indicator**: You'll see:
```
VITE ready in 2000ms
➜ Local: http://localhost:5173/
```

**Open your browser to: http://localhost:5173/**

**Demo Steps**:
1. **Open Browser Developer Tools** (F12)
2. **Go to Application/Storage → Local Storage**
3. **Add Key**: `mock-jwt-header`
4. **Add Value**: Copy one of the JSON values above
