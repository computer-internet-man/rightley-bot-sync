## 🧪 Test Categories

### Unit Tests
- **Authentication (`auth.test.ts`)**: JWT validation, role-based access control
- **Draft Generation (`generateDraft.test.ts`)**: OpenAI integration with stubbing
- **Delivery Providers (`delivery-providers.test.ts`)**: Message delivery interfaces
- **Queue Producer (`queue-producer.test.ts`)**: Job enqueueing and validation

### Integration Tests  
- **API Integration (`api.integration.test.ts`)**: Full API endpoint testing with authentication
- **Workflow Integration (`flow.integration.test.ts`)**: Complete user workflows
- **Queue Integration (`queue.integration.test.ts`)**: Producer/consumer flow testing
- **Export Integration (`export.integration.test.ts`)**: CSV export with real data

## 🛠️ Test Utilities

### Database Setup (`test-db-setup.ts`)
- Automatic database migration for tests
- Test data seeding with realistic fixtures
- Proper cleanup between test runs
- Graceful handling of missing D1 environment

### Authentication Helpers (`test-auth.ts`)
- JWT token generation for test users
- Role-based test user creation (admin, doctor, auditor)
- Authenticated request helpers
- Authorization header management

### Environment Mocking (`mock-env.ts`)
- OpenAI API mocking for cost-effective testing
- Queue service mocking
- Delivery provider mocking
- Sentry integration mocking

### Test Helpers (`test-helpers.ts`)
- Response validation utilities
- JSON and CSV response handling
- Common assertion patterns
- Error status validation

## 📊 Available Scripts

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run unit tests only  
pnpm test:unit

# Run integration tests only
pnpm test:integration

# Watch mode for development
pnpm test:watch

# Generate coverage report
pnpm test:coverage
```

## 🔧 Key Features

### AI Stub Mode
- `AI_STUB=1` environment variable enables OpenAI mocking
- Cost-effective testing without consuming API credits
- Predictable responses for consistent testing

### Database Isolation  
- Each test file gets isolated database state
- Automatic cleanup prevents test interference
- Proper migration handling in test environment

### Queue Testing
- Mock queue producers and consumers
- Job processing simulation
- Delivery status tracking
- Error handling and retry logic

### Authentication Testing
- JWT token validation
- Role-based access control verification
- Session management testing
- Security header validation

### Coverage Reporting
- V8 coverage provider for accurate metrics
- HTML and JSON report generation
- Excludes test files and configurations
- Configurable coverage thresholds

## 🎪 Testing Scenarios Covered

### Authentication Flow
- JWT validation and expiration
- User role permissions (admin, doctor, auditor)
- Unauthorized access prevention
- Token manipulation security

### Draft Generation
- OpenAI integration (stubbed and real)
- Rate limiting handling
- Patient context inclusion
- Error recovery and logging

### Message Delivery
- Multiple delivery providers
- Failure handling and retries
- Status tracking and webhooks
- Batch delivery processing

### API Endpoints
- CRUD operations with proper validation
- HTTP method validation
- Content-type requirements
- Error response formatting

### Queue Processing
- Job enqueueing and processing
- Batch operations
- Dead letter queue handling
- Performance monitoring

### Audit Trail
- Action logging and compliance
- CSV export functionality
- Date range filtering
- User activity tracking

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Environment Setup
- Tests automatically skip database operations if D1 is unavailable
- Wrangler configuration must include proper assets directory
- Environment variables properly isolated for testing

### Mock Strategy
- External APIs (OpenAI, Sentry) are mocked by default
- Real API testing available when keys provided
- Queue operations use mock interfaces
- Database operations use real D1 (when available)

### Performance Considerations
- Test concurrency limited to 4 for stability
- Timeouts set to 30 seconds for complex operations
- Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks
- Console output minimized for faster runs

## ✅ Verification Results

### Test Execution
- ✅ Basic test setup verification passed
- ✅ Vitest configuration working correctly
- ✅ Workers runtime integration functional
- ✅ Database setup and teardown working
- ✅ Mock utilities properly configured

### Coverage Setup
- ✅ V8 coverage provider configured
- ✅ Report generation working
- ✅ Exclusion patterns properly set
- ✅ HTML and JSON outputs available

### Integration Points
- ✅ SELF.fetch() for internal requests working
- ✅ Environment variable injection working
- ✅ Queue mocking functional
- ✅ Authentication helpers working

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Run Full Test Suite**: Execute all tests to verify complete functionality
2. **Implement Missing Tests**: Add tests for any uncovered edge cases
3. **CI/CD Integration**: Set up automated testing in deployment pipeline
4. **Performance Benchmarks**: Add performance testing for critical paths
5. **Security Testing**: Implement security-specific test scenarios

## 📚 Usage Examples

### Running Specific Tests
```bash
# Test specific functionality
pnpm vitest run tests/unit/auth.test.ts

# Test with coverage
pnpm vitest run --coverage tests/integration/

# Debug mode
pnpm vitest run --reporter=verbose tests/unit/
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Start watch mode for development
pnpm test:watch

# Run tests after changes
pnpm test:unit

# Generate coverage report
pnpm test:coverage
```

The testing framework is now ready for comprehensive testing of the AI Concierge application with proper Workers runtime simulation and database integration.
